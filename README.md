# Git-Github
I had a permission denial while trying to push my project,
I realised while I generate my fine-grained personal access token I did not granted myself permissionsin other to push or merge to my repo.
I what i did was to delete fine-grained personal access token and regenerated it while giving it all the permissions that will allow me push. It worked!!
